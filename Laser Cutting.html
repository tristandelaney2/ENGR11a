                                        For this project, it was important to remember key differences between additive and reductive processes when designing the clock face. One important factor is when 3D printing, you have to add a tolerance for the width of the filament as it presses out. This number is not exact and it may take a few tries to find the perfect tolerance. However, with laser cutting, we know the thickness of our material. In this case, the plywood was 3mm. Therefore, when sketching my design I knew the face of my clock had to fit within the edges of the box. So, I designed the length of the box to be the length of the clock face plus 2 x ply, to take into account the 3mm plywood on each side. This allowed for a much easier and more precise fit.

                                        This first cut was so simple, the only settings I really had to pay attention to were speed and power. Originally, they were set up as 100% speed with 20% power, but I realized this would not cut through the 3mm plywood as it was too fast with not enough power to fully cut. I learned that to ensure you fully cut through the material, it is better to give the laser more time at each spot, so I reduced my speed to 20% and increased my power to 100%. Even though I slowed it down, the entire cut took about 5 minutes, and that included other students’ cuts with mine. Speed is definitely an advantage of laser cutting! One thing I did differently with my design was I used the parameters setting. This was super easy to use and was very helpful in making all of my shapes the length and width I wanted. I accidentally made my dimensions too literal to the sketch of my circuit board like I did in the 3D print version. I added about 2mm of tolerance, however, I forgot to take the thickness of the plywood into account, and also the connector of the battery. However, since I used a parameter to define “ply” as a thickness of 3mm, I could go back and add “length + 2*ply” to each dimension to adjust for the thickness of the walls on each side. This was great and made adjusting my design so simple, I will definitely continue using parameters in the future. I did a depth of 49.5mm, this was fine but a bit too big for the total thickness of my circuit board and battery, so the battery didn’t fit nicely against the face. On my next cut, I will try to decrease the width a bit and see how it changes the fit.

                                        <p class="card-text">
                                        When making the face for my clock, I wanted to first make sure it would fit inside the box and that the holes were lined up correctly. I used the dimensions from my 3D print clock for the laser cut design, however I moved the speaker hole over about 2mm, because it didn’t fit quite right on the 3D print. Then, I decided to add two holes in the side of the clock, for the wire to connect from the battery, run through the hole, then connect to the connector on the circuit, so the wires wouldn’t be clumped within the clock, making it harder to maneuver. I reprinted the body with the new dimensions and my first face. It all fits very well! All the buttons are visible and aligned well. The face however, since not jointed with the rest of the box, is almost just resting on the inside of the body, since there is little pressure pushing from the sides to hold it in place, it can slip out fairly easily. My plan is to try building the box again but adding finger joints to the face as well.                                    </p>

                                        <p class="card-text">
                                      One of my biggest struggles with this was trying to use the same method of mirroring the side pieces over an axis, to mirror the bottom piece onto the top of the structure. Since I created the base as a center-point rectangle, it created an origin with the x axis across the bottom of the base. This means, when I reflected over the x-axis, it only reflected across that line, and therefore not all the way to the top of my box. I decided to start over with a new box, now knowing how to make finger joints, this time, reflecting the finger joints at the bottom of the sides, to the top of the sides, to essentially mirror the base. Laser cutting is so simple and fast that the biggest time constraint was just designing the box with the new joints. This gave me more experience with mirroring. For example, when trying to mirror joints from the side to the top of the box, the only mirror surface available was the origin faces on the base. So I learned to create a construction line going across the middle, then dimension this line from the middle to the bottom of the box, then I could reflect the joints to the top and adjust the dimensions of the middle line so they would line up at the top. You may notice in my fusion sketch that there are purple dots at just about each corner of the design. That's because when importing into Lightburn, the pieces had to be flat, mimicking the flat plywood the laser would cut. The purple dots are from projecting each face of the clock, saving each face, then importing each face individually into lightburn. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of my lightburn settings and now my trial has expired.                        </p>

                                        I decided my box was pretty boring, so I decided to try engraving. It was actually super simple. First I imported the face of my box into LightBurn. Next I added text, edited the font and placed the location. Then I added a layer with the text selected. This allowed me to make specific settings for the words. I put the speed at 1000% and the power at 75%, it's important to change the line type from “line” to “fill”, this makes it a Raster. Since it is in Raster, the dots will not be as strong as lines, so really I should have put the power up to 90% or more, since this won’t cut the words out of the face. It turned out pretty cool though, I just wish I had used a higher power setting.

                                      Using the laser cutter was such a fun and unique experience. It is so cool how quickly your design can be cut from a piece of wood, or even engraved. Although the key difference to laser cutting is that it is a reductive process while 3D printing is additive, I find the difference to be in the design aspect. When designing 3D prints, since they are not always flat surfaces, you don’t have to worry so much about fitting pieces together to make the 3D object. However, with laser cutting, you can’t just design six rectangles of the same size to make a box, you have to actually think about how to assemble each piece to a whole once separated from the cutting material. I also found a big difference in how time is allocated when doing 3D printing and laser cutting. When 3D printing, most of the time is spent in the physical printing of the design. However, laser cutting only takes about 5-10 minutes to cut, but maybe more time to design since you have to create joints for the flat pieces to fit together. I also found that there are less settings you have to adjust on LightBurn than on PrusaSlicer. On LightBurn, your main slices settings are speed and power, while in PrusaSlicer, you have to go over infill, supports, brims, layer heights and more. This project was enjoyable as I learned a whole new side to 3D design, including joints, components, and mirroring. Also, I think the campfire-like smell is a plus! With my new skills, I hope to make laser cutting a new tool I can turn to for my future maker-works.
