                            <p class="card-text">Hi, I’m Tristan, a biology major at Brandeis University. Playing sports my whole life, I’ve grown up wanting to build prosthetics for the differently abled, so they can participate in their passions as well! Although Brandeis does not offer engineering as a major -yet- I am taking the ENGR11a class on Design and Methodology to gain a better understanding of the process of building prosthetics, while also learning how to make my ideas tangible. Anyways, here is my portfolio of work!</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">For this in class project, I worked with my fellow classmates to build a chair for a customer.  Our “customer” was an astronaut from the “Simpsons” who wanted to be able to sit without floating around while drinking his Tang. Our design was a memory foam inverse chair which would cushion him from the top. It also had a lever so the seat portion could raise and lower him into the cushion on the top so he could be secure and not float around. Then we made prototypes out of hard materials such as popsicle sticks. This was difficult as they were long and hard to form. We made a second prototype out of soft materials such as string and pipe-cleaners. These were much easier to fold but harder to hold structure. Lastly, we made a life size prototype out of cardboard and pipe cleaners. We used the wall for support and the chair provided to make modifications. Overall this was a fun experience talking through ideas, classifying them based on reasonability and importance, then building makeshift models. </p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Here we put together our own Mini Prusa 3D printers. They were already partially assembled, which was great because I doubt I could have figured out the electronics of the machine. However, the directions were written very small. Also, the parts were labeled with the instructions using color codes. Although this was helpful, I think it would have been more useful to have the physical parts labeled because it was confusing which part they were showing in the tiny images. Similarly, it was not easy to determine which way the axis were facing in relation to us for the directions, so maybe a diagram of the machine position would make the directions easier to follow along.

                                    <p class = "card-text">Other than those parts of the directions, the assembly was not very hard. The most challenging part was the crowded wires. There was the extruder bundle, heatbed bundle, and filament sensor cable. All three were thick cords that had to fit under a cover into the electronics holder. 
We had to line up the thickness of the cords with the different sized gaps in the cover, however this was difficult as we had already connected the wires inside the board in different arrangements. This means we had to twist the cords around in order to fit. It may have been helpful to show diagrams of how each cord should connect rather than just where each cord connects, to ensure the cords would fit in the right slots. Similarly, the hole for the LCD cable was very small and not centered. The cable could fit, but the teeth that connected it to the electronics was too thick, it took wiggling and a little bit of force to get it through. Since the hole was not centered with the electronics, the cord had to bend and could not lay flat within the board.

                                    <p class = "card-text"> When building our printer, it was very important to lay out all of our materials first, then go through the instructions step by step. First connecting the XZ axis to the Y axis. Then we had to connect the LCD cable and electronics. Finally we put together the spool holder which was the easiest part, sliding the holder onto the wheels. This process taught me to be patient and that orientation is very important for putting pieces in place. While this was frustrating at times, the gummy bears were a great snack break and it was so satisfying to use a 3D printer that I had built.

                                    <p class="card-text">Using the pre-loaded 3D Benchy CAM, I printed two different Benchies. The first one, in pink, was printed as is, no adjustments were made. The settings included a first layer height of 0.2mm with layer height at 0.35mm. The shell's top layer was set at 6 and the bottom was set at 1. The top and bottom shell thicknesses were set at the minimum thickness, 0.7mm and 0.5mm. Lastly, the fill density was set at 15% and there was a brim set as well. This Benchy came out very smooth, although with some stringing. I think the thin layers allowed for the smoothness as there weren’t large divots between the layers. Similarly, I believe the stringing may be part of the calibration of the printer as this was its first run, but also due to the humidity in the room affecting the temperature of the material.

                                    <p class ="card-text">My second Benchy project was printed to optimize the time with hopes of maintaining structural integrity. The original Benchy took about 2 hours to complete printing, while this Benchy took 43 minutes. I changed the settings to maximize layer height and thickness to reduce time by increasing the layer height to 0.35 for both layer height and the first layer. Then I reduced the solid layers setting top from 6 to 1, and bottom from 5 to 1. Although I thought this was similar to layer thickness so I’m unsure how decreasing it improved time. Maybe it actually means the number of layers? Then I changed the infill to 0%, but when I went to slice, I received a warning about the structural support, so I went back and made the infill 5%. This cut the infill time from about 23 minutes to about 16 minutes. Although the brim time took only about 20 seconds, I decided to take off the brim to see how it would affect the structure. Lastly, I went from the simple setting to the advanced setting and adjusted the speed for the print moves. The perimeters were set at 40mm/s and small perimeters at 25mm/s. If I decreased this speed anymore, it actually added time to the print; I’m not sure why this happens, but my best guess is that it’s because it affects the quality of the print so it adds time elsewhere. The second Benchy, orange, actually did not turn out bad! Its structure was the same size and shape as the first, however the lines were a bit messy on the bottom, similarly there were quite a few gaps between layers on the sides and on the top. This is most likely caused by the increased thickness.

                                           While I love both my Benchy’s, it is clear that the speed is a tradeoff for structure. The process of optimizing the time took much back and forth, making small adjustments then slicing to see how it affected the time and structure, then going back and readjusting. I think the three main takeaways for optimizing time were reducing the infill, adjusting the perimeter speed and increasing the layer height. Moving forward, I think density fill should still be a priority for the structure rather than speed. I feel that my machine was calibrated well for both prints as I did not have issues with the temperature of the material and both prints were printed in the center of the heating bed. Overall, I enjoyed working with the Prusa slicer to see the effects of settings on the actual structure and it has made 3D printing that much more fun to work with!
