                                        <p class="card-text">
                                          The first part of building our own alarm clock was soldering the wires to the circuit board. For those who don’t know, soldering is the process of combining two metals by melting a filler metal between the two. By doing this, we connected the battery to a circuit board with resistors, LED lights and time control buttons. At first, this process was very intimidating as it is nothing I’ve ever seen or done before. However, it was quite simple. We used a soldering iron which would get very hot, then we would hold the iron on the wire towards the base of the board. Next we would slowly guide the solder towards the wire with the iron, allowing for it to melt around the wire and hold it in place. When soldering, be sure to continue wiping off the tip of the iron to prevent build up from occurring. One mistake I continued to run into was too much solder, this inhibits the flow of current through the wire. You can tell you have too much solder when it forms a rounded bubble shape. Ideally you will have a concave shape. Luckily, it is easy to undo this mistake. When I added too much solder, I would use the iron to reheat the solder on the circuit so it would melt, then use a solder sucker to pull off the extra. While my clock face turned on after we finished soldering, the following class period, my clock would not turn on. We used a multimeter to measure the current of the battery to ensure it wasn’t just dead. Then we checked the wire’s voltage and the resistors’ voltage, which also worked just fine. It did not look like we had any soldering issues by the looks of our circuit board, however we may need to go back and try to re-solder some parts to see if it will fix the issue. Overall, I thought the soldering process was very fun and a cool skill to learn.

                                           To build the enclosure for our clock, we had to measure each parameter of the face, including but not limited to: width, length, height, screen height/width/length, button depth, speaker diameter and depth, offset from the frame, and the distance between each screen/button. This was very tedious and as I tried designing the face in Fusion360, I realized I missed a few measurements, but luckily the class was helpful in ensuring everyone had each measurement. Then we had to measure the battery size, although this was much easier since it’s more of a simple rectangular shape with less components. My first clock face design was a long process. Figuring out how to extrude shapes, then make offsets and extrude in the opposite direction to create holes. I ended up getting so tangled up by going back and forth in my timeline trying to fix extrusions that Fusion360 quit on me because it didn’t know what I was asking. I ended up starting over and it took me about half the time. Before printing I realized that I actually created the cover to the exact measurements of the clock with zero tolerance, so I knew it wouldn’t fit. I tried scaling the whole thing from 100% to 115%. Unfortunately, this also shifted each component. The next time, I made the cover bigger by about 0.5 of all components. I also extruded my face back to enclose the circuit board. Next I made a beehive shaped body to hold my clock. This was a huge challenge, but it forced me to learn Fusion360. I learned how to do offsets, work with planes and rotations about axes, and even how to chamfer. This allowed me to build each layer of the beehive. Once I had that, I made an offset plane parallel to the face of the beehive, then I extruded a rectangle of the clock cover dimensions (+1.5mm) into the face to make a hole. Lastly, I added another rectangle of the dimensions of the battery plus about 2mm on each side for the battery hole. One thing I tried to do in my design was make the holes larger enough so that the cover would fit close enough to the circuit to press the buttons, however, the extrusions were very difficult to change after working with and I could not quite get this right.

                                           After printing my clock cover and beehive, I tried to see how they all fit together. The clock and circuit board just barely didn’t fit into the cover, the length was perfect but it was just barely too small. While I could try to file it down, it would have taken a while to file down one long layer. Even though the cover was just barely too small, the cover fit the beehive almost perfectly, it was the right length and the height was small by about 1mm. Then I looked at how the cover lined up with the components of the clock face. The speaker hole was too far to the left by about 5mm. The screens were also slightly over to the right, but not by much. Taking all this into account I went back to fusion and increased the height of my cover by 1.5mm, the height of the beehive hole by .5mm, and I moved the speaker hole right by 5mm. When printing the cover, I originally tried to place the hollow side down with supports going on the inside. This made the supports very difficult to get off, and actually broke pieces off the inside of my print while also causing some weird extrusion on the face. Next time I printed the outer surface of the cover face down which worked much better.

                                           In my final product, the clock fit the cover snug but well, and the cover fit the beehive a little loose. I could possibly have decreased the beehive hole length by about 0.25mm and this might have made for a more stable cover-body fit. But the battery fit nicely in the hole, and the clock was readable. The cover face still printed a bit wonky, but I think this may have been caused by having the slice settings set to perimeters of 12, causing holes in the design. Next time, I will lower the perimeter size to 2 for a more complete print. This project definitely tested my patience while pushing my limits. I had no idea how much goes into taking an object, measuring it, designing something with tolerance to fit, then actually printing the pieces to fit together. My Fusion skills improved drastically, although with much pain. But the final product is something I’m proud of, even if the clock won’t turn on.                                         </p>
