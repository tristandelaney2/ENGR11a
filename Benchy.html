Playing sports my whole life, I’ve grown up wanting to build prosthetics for the differently abled, so they can participate in their passions as well! Although Brandeis does not offer engineering as a major -yet- I am taking the ENGR11a class on Design and Methodology to gain a better understanding of the process of building prosthetics, while also learning how to make my ideas tangible. Anyways, here is my portfolio of work!</p-->

                                    <p class="card-text">Using the pre-loaded 3D Benchy CAM, I printed two different Benchies. The first one, in pink, was printed as is, no adjustments were made. The settings included a first layer height of 0.2mm with layer height at 0.35mm. The shell's top layer was set at 6 and the bottom was set at 1. The top and bottom shell thicknesses were set at the minimum thickness, 0.7mm and 0.5mm. Lastly, the fill density was set at 15% and there was a brim set as well. This Benchy came out very smooth, although with some stringing. I think the thin layers allowed for the smoothness as there weren’t large divots between the layers. Similarly, I believe the stringing may be part of the calibration of the printer as this was its first run, but also due to the humidity in the room affecting the temperature of the material.

                                    <p class ="card-text">My second Benchy project was printed to optimize the time with hopes of maintaining structural integrity. The original Benchy took about 2 hours to complete printing, while this Benchy took 43 minutes. I changed the settings to maximize layer height and thickness to reduce time by increasing the layer height to 0.35 for both layer height and the first layer. Then I reduced the solid layers setting top from 6 to 1, and bottom from 5 to 1. Although I thought this was similar to layer thickness so I’m unsure how decreasing it improved time. Maybe it actually means the number of layers? Then I changed the infill to 0%, but when I went to slice, I received a warning about the structural support, so I went back and made the infill 5%. This cut the infill time from about 23 minutes to about 16 minutes. Although the brim time took only about 20 seconds, I decided to take off the brim to see how it would affect the structure. Lastly, I went from the simple setting to the advanced setting and adjusted the speed for the print moves. The perimeters were set at 40mm/s and small perimeters at 25mm/s. If I decreased this speed anymore, it actually added time to the print; I’m not sure why this happens, but my best guess is that it’s because it affects the quality of the print so it adds time elsewhere. The second Benchy, orange, actually did not turn out bad! Its structure was the same size and shape as the first, however the lines were a bit messy on the bottom, similarly there were quite a few gaps between layers on the sides and on the top. This is most likely caused by the increased thickness.

                                        <p class="card-text">
                                           While I love both my Benchy’s, it is clear that the speed is a tradeoff for structure. The process of optimizing the time took much back and forth, making small adjustments then slicing to see how it affected the time and structure, then going back and readjusting. I think the three main takeaways for optimizing time were reducing the infill, adjusting the perimeter speed and increasing the layer height. Moving forward, I think density fill should still be a priority for the structure rather than speed. I feel that my machine was calibrated well for both prints as I did not have issues with the temperature of the material and both prints were printed in the center of the heating bed. Overall, I enjoyed working with the Prusa slicer to see the effects of settings on the actual structure and it has made 3D printing that much more fun to work with!
