                            <p class="card-text">Hi, I’m Tristan, a biology major at Brandeis University. Playing sports my whole life, I’ve grown up wanting to build prosthetics for the differently abled, so they can participate in their passions as well! Although Brandeis does not offer engineering as a major -yet- I am taking the ENGR11a class on Design and Methodology to gain a better understanding of the process of building prosthetics, while also learning how to make my ideas tangible. Anyways, here is my portfolio of work!</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Here we put together our own Mini Prusa 3D printers. They were already partially assembled, which was great because I doubt I could have figured out the electronics of the machine. However, the directions were written very small. Also, the parts were labeled with the instructions using color codes. Although this was helpful, I think it would have been more useful to have the physical parts labeled because it was confusing which part they were showing in the tiny images. Similarly, it was not easy to determine which way the axis were facing in relation to us for the directions, so maybe a diagram of the machine position would make the directions easier to follow along.

                                    <p class = "card-text">Other than those parts of the directions, the assembly was not very hard. The most challenging part was the crowded wires. There was the extruder bundle, heatbed bundle, and filament sensor cable. All three were thick cords that had to fit under a cover into the electronics holder. 
We had to line up the thickness of the cords with the different sized gaps in the cover, however this was difficult as we had already connected the wires inside the board in different arrangements. This means we had to twist the cords around in order to fit. It may have been helpful to show diagrams of how each cord should connect rather than just where each cord connects, to ensure the cords would fit in the right slots. Similarly, the hole for the LCD cable was very small and not centered. The cable could fit, but the teeth that connected it to the electronics was too thick, it took wiggling and a little bit of force to get it through. Since the hole was not centered with the electronics, the cord had to bend and could not lay flat within the board. </p>

                                    <p class = "card-text"> When building our printer, it was very important to lay out all of our materials first, then go through the instructions step by step. First connecting the XZ axis to the Y axis. Then we had to connect the LCD cable and electronics. Finally we put together the spool holder which was the easiest part, sliding the holder onto the wheels. This process taught me to be patient and that orientation is very important for putting pieces in place. While this was frustrating at times, the gummy bears were a great snack break and it was so satisfying to use a 3D printer that I had built.
